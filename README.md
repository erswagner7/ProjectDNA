**2021-2022**

**Project Name: PROJECT DNA**
# **Project Summary:** 
Project DNA will provide elderly users who may be suffering with dementia the ability to receive in-home support from a loved one or sponsor remotely. The desktop application will connect the patient with their caregiver, who will have the ability to assist in daily activities by setting reminders for events, keeping track of medication, and monitoring incidents all from a single, simple application.

**Problem Statement:**

The ongoing pandemic has put many families with elderly family members in a difficult situation. Fears of infecting an older relative, who may not have a healthy enough immune system to fight this deadly virus, have forced many elderly people into isolation. 

Living in isolation can have devastating outcomes for those aged 65+. A NASEM (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) report on, “*Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults”* tells us that an elderly person increases their risk for developing Dementia by 50% when they live in isolation. For those who already have developed Dementia, isolation puts them further at risk of death or serious injury.

During these emergency periods of time where in-person contact is limited, there must be some way for families to keep in contact with their elderly relatives.
# **Solution:**
Project DNA will solve isolation among Demetia patients by providing a comforting connection between the Dementia patient and the loved relative or caregiver. Our desktop application will be familiar and simple to use for elderly technology users. Caregivers will be able to send comforting messages, reminders, and monitor medication using project DNA.

N/A
# **Project Source:**
This idea was concocted by our team of 5. Most of our team have elderly family members who have suffered or are currently suffering from Dementia or Alzheimer's disease. 

Technology provides us with ways to make lives easier. Our group wants to use our skills as information technology students to make life easier for those who may be suffering through degenerative disabilities like dementia. Our home application aims to connect a patient with a trusted family member or sponsor, providing them with a simple to use, one stop application for confirming medication, contacting, and monitoring dementia patients.

The driving principle of our design is ease of use for the patient. According to Oscar Andersons research article, “Technology Use and Attitudes among Mid-Life and Older Americans.” Senior citizens are more likely to own and use a desktop as opposed to a mobile device. Our project aims to meet its users on a system they are already comfortable with, rather than try to teach elderly users an entirely new device when their tech literacy may already be hindered. 
# **Project Objectives/Goals:**
Our group hopes to provide a means of reducing feelings of social isolation among dementia patients who are physically isolated. Project DNA will reduce perceived isolation by providing means of communication that is socially distant but remains social at its core. Project DNA will also be a means of ensuring a patient is receiving the proper medication, while the caregiver remains remote.

Daily Interaction

- The bare minimum use of our application provides the caregiver and patient with at least one interaction per day. This daily interaction will decrease the feeling of loneliness in the isolated party.

Voice Reminders

- Provides the patient with a personalized, comforting experience.

Medication Monitoring

- Provides the caregiver a means of confirming their patient is medicating appropriately while remaining physically remote.
# **Team Members and Responsibilities:**

Software Developers: Erich Wagner, Alexander Burnett 

- Responsible for technical architecture
- Responsible for setup and maintenance of server environment. 
- Responsible for full stack development


Security Analysts: Hannah Hupp, Kathan Patel

- Responsible for analyzing and implementing security measures
- Responsible for monitoring network for security issues
- Responsible for penetration testing

UX/UI Designers: Jamie Miozzi

- Responsible for designing user endpoint interfaces
- Responsible for working with Software Developers to build those interfaces
- Responsible for hardware adaptation
# **Project Scope:**
Our team will develop a functioning application that allows a caregiver to send voice messages that act as reminders to their patient. The dementia patient may need reminders for medication on a daily basis or for less frequent events like a doctor's appointment.

The familiar voice will reduce the isolation felt by the patient. The patient will feel more connected and less alone by hearing the voice of their caregiver.

The patient will be able to respond to each message or reminder. The responses act as monitoring process. The patient must confirm their medication daily, if this confirmation is not given, the caregiver will be alerted. Messages or reminders that don’t receive a response or confirmation are also helpful indicators for the caregiver.

These are the expectations we plan to meet at the IT Expo in April.

# **Technologies Used:**

A brief description of technologies you intend to use for the development and implementation of your solution. 

Until we can come up with a design for the home device, we plan on starting our project from a desktop application.

Front-end

C# - Language for front end development

Back-end 

SQL server – Backend data handling

Project DeepSpeech – Speech recognition

Physical technology

Raspberry pi – External device handling

Microphone – Voice capture

Other Resources

GitHub - Kanban board, project sharing
# **Ethical Considerations:**

Project DNA aims to assist users with a medical diagnosis. Our user's privacy will be of utmost concern. The data handled in our application must be secure and encrypted to ensure that our users' right to medical privacy is kept.
# **Team Rules:**

Use this section to highlight the collective values of the team members.

1. Always be respectful to others (in meetings, in all communications)
1. Maintain communication as much as possible (respond within 24 hours)
   1. Communications will take place on Microsoft Teams
1. Try to attend all Monday meetings either in-person or remotely
1. Work together to reach common goals
   1. When a disagreement occurs, a vote will be held among the 5 group members, the majority opinion wins.
1. Make sure to cite sources
1. Hold regular stand-up meetings at least once per week
