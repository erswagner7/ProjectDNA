# Abstract

Covid-19 has contributed to the rising number and worsened effects of dementia.â€¯The most significant explanation for this trend is the need for social isolation from loved ones. The current generation of medication management software has the capability to connect dementia patients with their caregiver or loved ones during these difficult times. These applications are useful, but Project DNA wants to take medication management to the next level. Our group has created an application that allows this to be done. By interweaving the task of taking daily medication with a social experience, Project DNA aims to decrease feelings of social isolation in dementia patients who typically receive in-home care.
